The [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/) is a U.S. government agency that is responsible for science and technology related to air and space.
It also provide a digital interface, namely the [NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/), to programmatically access NASA's extensive datasets. 
The APIs make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to the public. 
It provides a choice of standard web output formats, either JSON or HTML, of response format

This web appilcation provides a Python-wrapper around the JSON API provided by NASA Open APIs. 
At the moment the wrapper only implements the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" JSON API. 
The response is displayed in a web browser. More different JSON API wrapper will be added in this web application in later stage.
